Make it big enough to extend a foot beyond your cooking grate in all directions. Build a brick rectangle 3 layers high, leaving a couple of bricks out of the top layer on opposite sides, to encourage airflow. (For a standard 21-in. round Weber grate, the rectangle should be 2 bricks by 3 bricks.) Fill with about an inch of sand.', 'Light the fire: Put several balled-up sheets of newspaper in the center and position kindling into a tipi around it; lean larger kindling and then 5 to 6 small logs (preferably oak). Light the fire. 'The tipi lets every bit of flame go up past 3 or 4 logs,' says Chiarello, so the fire starts fast. Once the logs have caught, add several larger logs to the perimeter. Let them burn down to ashy chunks with low flames (1 1/2 to 2 hours). Because there\'s less smoke and char than cooking over a flaming fire, Chiarello says, 'it makes your food taste much cleaner, gives nuanced flavor, and is better for wine.'', 'Start cooking: Keep another log burning at the back of the pit.

Be sure to check that your thermometer works accurately and adjust accordingly if it doesn't. For example: if water boils at 212° on your thermometer, your thermometer works accurately. If it boils at 210°, cook this recipe to 233°; if the boiling point on your thermometer is 214°, cook this recipe to 237°. Be sure that the bulb of the candy thermometer is fully submerged in syrup but does not touch bottom of saucepan. Don't beat candy too long; it hardens quickly as it cools. Beating candy in a separate bowl helps prevent the grainy texture that results from accidentally scraping any crystals off sides of pan.']","['sugar', 'vanilla', 'peanut butter', 'milk', 'butter', 'salt']",6,8.00379

Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer until the sugar is dissolved and the fruits are releasing their juices - takes about 5 minutes - don't overcook as you want the fruits to keep their shapes. Reserve about 3/4 C. of the juice, then cool and refrigerate. Pour the remainder of the fruit into the pudding basin - seal the top completely with slices of bread. Cover the bread with a flat plate/saucer that fits snugly inside the basin, then weigh down the plate with a 3-lb. weight (very heavy can or jar will do.)Leave in fridge overnight, the weight will cause the juice to bleed through the bread, staining it red. Gently slide a flexible spatula between the bread and the basin to loosen. Invert the bowl onto a serving dish - it should slide easily into place. Add a few drops of red coloring to the 3/4 C. set aside fruit juice, and use this to gently coat any areas that still have a white tinge - pour remainder of juice over entire pudding. Put the reserved raspberries all around the bottom of the pudding. Serve with real whipped cream and a sprig of mint or vanilla ice cream (optional.).']","['sugar', 'butter']",2,9.136

Wash hands.', '3. Notice you missed a few cloves and get those suckers out too.', '4. Wash hands (again).', 'You should have between 8-12 cloves. Use more or less depending on how garlicky you want the butter.', 'Now, there's a couple ways you can go about doing this.', 'The first way is a great stress reliever and involves a lot of mashing the garlic with the butter in a small dish with a fork, spoon, spatula, or other instrument of smashing, and will probably take a lot longer than the 3 minutes I've suggested. The result is still yummy and very edible so if you don't have a mini food processor, this is probably the way you should do it.', 'The second way involves a mini food processor and is a lot easier and faster, but much less emotionally satisfying.', '5. Drop the garlic cloves into the mini food processor.', '6. Cut the butter into chunks and add to the processor.', '7. Pulse it a few times until you realize that loaf of bread you just cut a slice off of is whimpering and then just hold the button down until the butter and garlic are melded into deliciousness, about 30 - 45 seconds.', '8. Get a big smear on a knife and spread it on a piece of bread and enjoy while trying to figure out how to get every last bit out of the processor.', '9. Scrape the garlic butter into a small airtight container and store for up to 3-4 days (see below).', 'Note: I only say this because I wouldn't trust it past that point. To be honest, the first time I made this recipe, I only used 1/4 stick of butter and the resulting stuff was gone in less than 24 hours, so I don't know that storage would really be an issue.', '10. Take a chunk of bread and run it around inside the processor container to get the rest of the garlic butter you missed.', 'Things I've done with this garlic butter:', 'Spread on fresh French bread and eaten it.', 'Spread on fresh French bread, topped with shredded mozzarella cheese and toasted it in the oven.', 'Spread it on corn-tortilla cheese quesadillas fresh off the frying pan.', 'Spread it on corn-tortilla cheese quesadillas BEFORE putting it on the frying pan (be careful with this, the stuff burns easily).', 'Spread it on roasted potatoes.', 'Tossed it with steamed broccoli.', 'And that was just in the past 12 hours.
